## City Seeds

This is an algorithmic generator that makes the seed for a city using modified tables found [here](http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2021/11/human-non-universals-or-make-your-own.html) and in Kevin Crawford's Worlds Without Number system, available [here](https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/collections/worlds-without-number).

Results should be interpreted as useful.

### TODO
* add auto-tagging based on file structure
