## City Seeds

This is a random generator of cultural characteristics intended to spark ideas and help draw threads. Feel free to take what you think is useful and discard the rest.

### The Lists
The lists are adapted from [this blog post](http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2021/11/human-non-universals-or-make-your-own.html) and in Kevin Crawford's Worlds Without Number system, available [here](https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/collections/worlds-without-number). I have made alterations and additions to these.

The lists of cultural characteristics are very incomplete and represent my own cultural biases. Pull requests to add to these are very welcome!

### TODO
* more categories!
* write to file
* proper input flag handling & documentation
* some sort of language generation
