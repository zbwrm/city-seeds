## Seed Grower

This is a generator that draws from "seeds", which are just tree-folders of .csv files with random tables in them.

Currently, the only seed is a culture generator adapted from [this blog post](http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2021/11/human-non-universals-or-make-your-own.html) and Kevin Crawford's Worlds Without Number system, available [here](https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/collections/worlds-without-number). I have made alterations and additions to these. The lists of cultural characteristics are very incomplete and represent my own cultural biases. 

Pull requests to add to these are very welcome!

### TODO
* de citi-fy the code (generalize? genericize?)
* recursivize the seed reader so it doesn't only go one layer deep
* more categories!
* write to file
* proper input flag handling & documentation
* some sort of language generation
